**plan.research-data.no** is a knowledge resource for research data management and data management planning in Norway. It is maintained by a collaboration of Norwegian higher education libraries and research infrastructures through an open contribution and maintenance process. We also wish to translate the user-directed resources to Norwegian in the future.

The resources originate in the 1-year project [Data Management Plans: Support package for Norwegian higher education libraries](/pages/project) led by the University of Bergen (UiB).
