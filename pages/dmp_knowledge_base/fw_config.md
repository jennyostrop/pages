This quick-start-guide lists steps in configuring a FAIR Wizard or DSW instance to achieve a similar configuration as the instance [norway.fair-wizard.com](/pages/dmp_wizard/#users-from-ntnu-uib-uio-uit). The page aims to support colleagues who are starting to use the tool and wish to set similar configuration settings to our instance.

[FAIR Wizard](https://fair-wizard.com/) is the software-as-a-service version of the Open Source DMP tool [Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW).](https://ds-wizard.org/). In addition to the Data Management Planner (which equals DSW), FAIR Wizard contains the module Admin Center, Integration Hub, and Analytics.\
The detailed user guide is available under [https://guide.fair-wizard.com/en/production/](guide.fair-wizard.com/).

### Import from Registry
* Import Knowledge Model from Registry: [Norwegian DSW Knowledge Model v1.1.0](https://registry.fair-wizard.com/knowledge-models/research.data.no:norway-generic:1.1.0)
	* [User guide](https://guide.fair-wizard.com/en/production/applications/data-management-planner/knowledge-models/list/import.html)
	* NB! Default templates should be created by selecting tags (see below)
	* NB! Export works currently only with default or lean Questionnaire Report (see below)
	* NB! FAIR sharing integration requires an API key under Knowledge Model Secrets (see below)
* Import Document Template from Registry: [Questionnaire report - lean](https://registry.fair-wizard.com/document-templates/research.data.no:questionnaire-report-lean:2.16.0)
	* [User guide](https://guide.fair-wizard.com/en/production/applications/data-management-planner/document-templates/list/import.html#from-fair-wizard-registry)

### Template setup
[User guide](https://guide.fair-wizard.com/en/production/applications/data-management-planner/projects/list/templates.html)
* The following steps are necessary to create a Project Template
	* Create project by selecting Knowledge Model and tags
	* **View**: Settings to your choice (e.g. everything hidden but non-desirable questions)
	* **Settings**: Set name and add description
	* **Settings**: Set default document template (e.g. Questionnaire Report - lean and HTML)
	* **Settings**: Enable *Project template*
	* **Share**: Enable *Visible by all other logged-in users*
* We are using four pre-set questionnaires to accommodate [different user needs](/pages/dmp_reflections#dmp-needs). See also the [guidance for researchers](/pages/support_00_start_writing#choose-the-right-project-template).
	* Minimum: tag minimum
	* Minimum and ELSI: tag minimum, ELSI
	* RCN/ Science Europe and ELSI: tag RCN/ Science Europe, ELSI
	* RCN/ Science Europe and ELSI and HPC: tag RCN/ Science Europe, ELSI, HPC
	* Other tags can be ignored for the setup
	* In addition, we have a freestanding [pre-award Knowledge Model](/pages/support_00_planning_considerations). We are uncertain whether this Knowledge Model will be continued.

### Integrations
A few preparations are necessary to use some of the integrations in the *Norwegian DSW Knowledge Model*.

#### Institutional resources
To keep the resources compatible with Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW), we have chosen to maintain the list of institutional policies and resources outside of the FAIR Wizard Integration Hub. This allows updating or adding policies without touching the Knowledge Model. We are currently using a [json-file in a GitHub repository](https://github.com/DHP-stottepakke/integrations "2026-02-25"), which is planned to be replaced by an integration. To propose changes, make a pull request or [get in touch](/pages/about/#contact).

#### FAIR sharing
The FAIR sharing integration requires an API key
* [User guide](https://guide.fair-wizard.com/en/production/applications/data-management-planner/knowledge-models/secrets.html#knowledge-model-secrets)
* Create API key: 1) Register FAIRsharing account. 2) Generate ApiKey with base64 in command line: <code> echo -n 'username:password' | base64
* **Data Management Planner** > Knowledge Models > Secrets: Set values for 'fairsharingApiKey' and 'fairsharingApiUrl'

## User management and test users
[User guide](https://guide.fair-wizard.com/en/production/applications/admin-center/users/index.html#)
* Default user role should be 'Researcher'
	* **Admin Center** > System 
* It can be useful to create dummy users to be able to test out different roles
	* **Admin Center** > Users: Invite button, create dummy user. If using a dummy email address, one can set a passphrase for the test user after creating the user.
